His new pet is a source of constant aggravation, destroying his apartment and threatening his promising career. Despite his misbehavior, Hooch turns out to be surprisingly useful, helping with everything from finding fugitives to protecting witnesses. Scott is desperate to train his new canine partner to be a little less embarrassing, and turns to Erica, a dog trainer with the Marshals. She helps Scott learn to understand and work with Hooch - though he remains completely oblivious to her crush on him. As Scott learns to work with his dog, he gets help and guidance from a pair of more experienced deputies - Jessica Baxter, who does her best to keep Scott focused on what's really important, and the enigmatic Xavier Wilson, an oddball with a lot of wisdom to share. Hooch also turns out to be the key to Scott's love life, as he finds himself at the center of a love triangle with Erica and his long-time crush US Attorney Brooke Mailer. Erica is supportive, fun, totally smitten with him, and Hooch's biggest fan. Scott, however, is more focused on Brooke, who is ambitious, totally focused and less than enthusiastic about Scott's big slobbery dog. While Scott works with the Marshals, he and his sister Laura team up to investigate a mysterious case left unfinished by their father before he died. They don't know what they're looking for, but they know that somehow Scott's new dog is the key to it all. Together with their father's old partner David Sutton, they begin to uncover a serious crime in their sleepy little hometown of Cypress Beach. The clock is ticking, innocent lives are at stake, and the only one who seems to be able to tie it all together is Hooch.

2aa63778-7fbc-4c37-aa50-aa53b5be8a9b,Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home,"Goofy’s back in a trio of all-new, hand-drawn animated shorts offering comical insights on “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” with such topics as mastering the skills of “How to Wear a Mask,” “Learning to Cook,” and “Binge Watching.” Like most of the world, Goofy -- the clumsy, charismatic and lovable Disney “everyman” character who has entertained and “educated” audiences from his screen debut in 1932, his breakout solo short, “Goofy and Wilbur” (1939), a series of popular “how to” shorts in the '40s, to career highlights including “A Goofy Movie” (1995), and the 2007 short “How to Hook Up Your Home Theater” -- spent the last year and a half staying at home. So it seemed only natural to acclaimed master animator/director Eric Goldberg (“Aladdin,” “Pocahontas,” “Fantasia/2000,” “Moana”) that Goofy could provide some good-natured lessons in “How to Stay at Home” and demonstrate how to make the best of today’s challenging situations.  Goldberg directed all three of the films in this series and was the supervising animator on “How to Wear a Mask.”  Joining him were fellow Disney veterans/supervising animators Mark Henn (“Binge Watching”) and Randy Haycock (“Learning to Cook”). The “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” series is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran/Emmy Award®-winner Dorothy McKim (“Meet the Robinsons,” the “Prep & Landing” television specials, and the Oscar®-nominated short, “Get a Horse!”). Bill Farmer, the voice of Goofy since 1987, provides the familiar vocals for the character, and versatile actor, Corey Burton, is heard as the narrator.",series,2021,8/11/21,disney,mickey_friends,"family,animation,comedy",,,,,,,,,,"<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/DB963F6CA8058AAEEDAFADB8F91585BB1BB5B9C3EA88CACBB6BF02366C1336C4/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>","<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/DB963F6CA8058AAEEDAFADB8F91585BB1BB5B9C3EA88CACBB6BF02366C1336C4/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>"

Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotize the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.

No major rules apply—filmmakers are driven by their need to tell a story and the nimble approach to do so.     ""A Spark Story"" introduces Aphton Corbin and Louis Gonzales, two filmmakers striving to get their uniquely personal SparkShorts visions on screen. Each, teamed with a producer, navigates the emotional rollercoaster of stepping into a leadership role and inspiring their crew. Corbin’s film, “Twenty Something,” required novel approaches to storytelling to convey one character's multiple perspectives—all using hand-drawn animation (a rarity for Pixar). Gonzales’ film, “Nona,” came from an intensely personal place, but that didn’t stop a serious bout of writer's block from nearly derailing the entire production.     Produced in collaboration with Pixar, ""A Spark Story"" comes from Supper Club (“Chef’s Table”) and directors Jason Sterman and Leanne Dare. The documentary will give audiences an exclusive and immersive look at the filmmakers and their short films, while also exploring the creative philosophy that makes Pixar unique.

a41fe809-15f1-463f-8449-4573318844bc,Black Beauty,"In this timeless reimagining of Anna Sewell’s classic novel, we follow the life of Black Beauty— a wild horse born free in the American West.  Beauty’s world is turned upside down when she and her family are cruelly rounded up and taken away from their home.  Beauty is sent to live in a dusty corral which she fears she may never escape. Beauty’s fortunes are destined to turn, however.  When the quiet, gentle horse whisperer John Manly arrives from New York to adopt a mustang, he notices Beauty’s fiery spirit.  Adopting her for his training program at Birtwick Stables, John is unsure if Beauty can ever be tamed.  She is heartbroken and angry over the loss of all she’s ever known, and does not trust the presence of humans. Soon, John’s world is upended when his niece, seventeen-year-old Jo Green, shows up on his doorstep.  Similar to Beauty, Jo has just lost her parents, and her spirit is close to breaking. It is through the profound connection between Beauty and Jo that both girl and horse begin to heal.

56ca8852-4819-483c-b1ae-d418ad0bcaf7,Myth: A Frozen Tale,"Inspired by the exciting environments, themes and elemental characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Frozen 2, acclaimed director Jeff Gipson (Cycles) brings to life this imaginative and vibrant tale set in an enchanted forest outside of Arendelle.  A family gathering for an evening of bedtime stories sets the stage for a magnificent adventure to a colorful and mythical world, which includes close encounters with the Nokk (a water spirit in the form of a mighty stallion), Gale (the playful wind spirit who can manifest as a light breeze or a raging tornado-like force), the Earth Giants (the massive creatures that form the rocky riverbanks and are capable of intense destruction when awakened), and the Fire Spirit (a fast-moving and mercurial salamander named Bruni).  As the story unfolds, these spirits come to life and the myth of their past and future is revealed. Production designer Brittney Lee drew upon the Studios’ legacy of great artists (Eyvind Earle, Mary Blair, and Frozen’s own production designer Michael Giaimo) along with her own instincts to create a visual landscape that was unique in its colors, shapes and style.  Just as Disney’s musical milestone, Fantasia, combined the power of music with striking visuals, producer Nicholas Russell and director Gipson, enlisted composer Joseph Trapanese (Tron: Legacy) to help them enhance the experience for Myth: A Frozen Tale.  Evan Rachel Wood (the voice of Queen Iduna in Frozen 2) lends her voice as the narrator of the film.  Finally, Myth is a tip of the hat to Gipson’s own family tradition of telling bedtime stories, including a particular story passed down from his great-great-great grandfather about a brush with the outlaw Jesse James when he was a young farm boy growing up near Kansas City.",short-form,2019,11/7/19,disney,frozen,"family,animation,fantasy,kids",,,,,wilderness,"religion,spirituality",spirit_beings,"nick_a_fisher,bonnie_popp,john_lavelle,vivienne_rutherford,evan_rachel_wood",,"<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/A442CDEDE5FDB3EE9996C6DED3CE9EC173196C6A44DD1C3D421E20CC612F57A4/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>","<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/A442CDEDE5FDB3EE9996C6DED3CE9EC173196C6A44DD1C3D421E20CC612F57A4/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>"

When a deadly epidemic strikes the town of Nome, Alaska and the only cure is more than 600 miles away, the town looks to champion dogsled trainer Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) to help transport an antitoxin serum. Seppala turns to Togo, an unassuming, undersized and aging Siberian husky, to be his lead. His wife (Julianne Nicholson) has championed Togo since his days as a mischievous puppy who could dig himself out of any situation, literally and physically, and Seppala, having observed Togo’s loyalty and tenacious spirit, knows Togo offers his only chance of surviving this mission. Undaunted by the massive storm heading their way or pressure from his wife not to go, Seppala and Togo set out on the deadliest leg of what becomes a larger relay involving multiple mushers, facing gale force winds, 50 below zero temperatures and little to no visibility. It is an intense journey that causes the veteran musher to grasp the depth of his feelings for his lead dog and the unbreakable bond they share.

f7441b33-dbf4-4c7d-8d67-d70a4ce6354a,Elephant,"African elephant Shani and her spirited son Jomo set out on an epic journey with their herd, traveling hundreds of miles across the vast Kalahari Desert, from the Okavango delta to the Zambezi River, just as countless generations of their ancestors have done before. Shani and her family are among the last elephants on earth to make these lengthy migrations. She’s mother to wide-eyed, one-year-old Jomo, who has yet to experience a migration, and at 40 years old, she is next in line as herd matriarch, a position currently held by her older sister Gaia. Gaia’s herd is among countless species — from hippopotamus to lechwe to baboons — that rely upon the life-giving water that flows from the mountains and transforms the heart of the desert into a green oasis known as the Okavango delta. But the season’s end is near and soon there will be a mass exodus. Nothing on Earth is more precious to life than water. And perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than the Kalahari desert in southern Africa, one of the driest places on the planet. The water is receding and paradise will soon turn to dust as the delta becomes a series of vanishing pools. Gaia instinctively knows she must lead the herd directly into the baking Kalahari desert, before the remaining water holes dry up. The herd’s success will depend on her experience and wisdom, which has been handed down over many generations. Just as the saying “an elephant never forgets” implies, these massive mammals have a deep connection to their past.  Gaia will take her family down ancient elephant paths, networks of lines and circles — the circles being water holes the family will desperately need to cross the vast desert. Along the way, they’ll seek nourishment from sources such as moisture-rich mopane leaves and baobab tree trunks filled with rainwater.  As they near their destination, the herd must cross the mighty Zambezi River to reach the safe haven for which they’ve been searching. They must enter the shallows, where crocodiles prey upon elephant calves like Jomo, and fight a ferocious current that could draw them into the world’s greatest waterfall, Victoria Falls. Fortunately, the herd has the strength and stamina to succeed and can rest while enjoying unlimited water and all the palm nuts they can shake from the trees. But within a few short months, food is scarce and the water begins its voyage back to the Okavango delta. The family must traverse the wilds of Africa, yet again. The march back to the delta will be no easy task, as the Angolan flood waters are early this year and the herd will need to make quick time. However, the emotional bonds between elephants are as strong as those between humans and the strength of family has gotten them this far. Together, Gaia, Shani, Jomo and family dare to take the shortest route … through lion country.",movie,2020,4/3/20,disney,"walt_disney_studios_live_action,disneynature","family,documentary,animals_nature",,,,africa,"desert,wilderness",educational,"baby_animals,animals,wild_animals,elephants","colleen_church,frank_logan,frank_logan",,"<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/09FD24576C231E097513CDBC1FB3D7BA1F35A0CF7C6CC4A620668DD80C12C9E3/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>","<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/09FD24576C231E097513CDBC1FB3D7BA1F35A0CF7C6CC4A620668DD80C12C9E3/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>"

He doesn’t comprehend that soon he will play a vital role in both his own survival and the survival of the colorful, living, breathing city that he and his family call home. The reef is an intricately balanced ecosystem in which each citizen contributes: from the millions of plants and creatures which inhabit the coral to the gardener fish that feed upon its lush growth to the predators — like Echo — that keep the fish population in check. At three years old, Echo has relied solely on his mother, Kumu, to feed and protect him. Now he’s weaned off mother’s milk and it’s time to catch his own meals and develop the essential skills needed to thrive in his underwater world. However, the teachings of his mother tend to go unnoticed by Echo, who’s distracted by more enjoyable pursuits. Echo often can be found balancing a shell upon his rostrom or investigating the many fascinating residents of the reef, such as the fastidious peacock mantis shrimp or the bumphead parrotfish, with a face only a mother could love. He’s particularly distracted by a 40-foot humpback whale and her newborn calf, who create a massive wake that’s hard to resist. As Echo gains more independence, he discovers that even a giant creature like the humpback whale has something to fear in the deep blue. The pod must sleep with one eye open — which, in fact, they do — with the ocean’s greatest hunter, the orca, nearby. These black-and-white behemoths prey upon bottlenose dolphins and whale calves. Even as predators themselves, the ocean contains numerous dangers for Echo and his family. They must also be wary of creatures such as the giant stingray, with its razor-sharp venomous tail, and the shark that even reef sharks fear: the tiger shark. But there’s power in numbers and Echo and his pod rely upon one another for safety and comfort. They’re a close-knit community, which communicates in a complex language of squeaks and clicks, and conveys reassurance through physical contact. The key to their survival is teamwork. Kumu is determined to make Echo a contributing member of the team and has been encouraging him to use echolocation, a highly sophisticated sonar, to find fish buried in the sand. Now it’s time for a master class. Mother and son set out on a journey to the pod’s favorite group hunting grounds, the legendary muddy shallows, where she’ll teach Echo her high-speed technique for corralling fish. If Echo can master this skill, he’ll become both self-sufficient and a valued member of the pod – a community that’s vital to the success of the reef and the health of our oceans worldwide.",movie,2018,3/28/18,disney,"walt_disney_studios_live_action,disneynature","family,documentary,animals_nature",,,,,aquatic,educational,"wild_animals,animals,dolphins",,,"<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/F4DA78B20AE07EB91EAD094D0477F9DDB2D6B6A545DE30F04BA112C1C2AF0FCE/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>","<img src=""https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/F4DA78B20AE07EB91EAD094D0477F9DDB2D6B6A545DE30F04BA112C1C2AF0FCE/scale?width=130&faspectRatio=1.0&format=jpeg"" style=max-height:240px;max-width:130px;""/>"

In 1975, Wolfgang came to Los Angeles - at the time a culinary desert, known for hamburgers and old fashioned, stogy dining.  His French training and adventurous spirit combined to create a new style of food and dining in LA.
